    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance brokers are challenged to retain their client base while growing business in diverse markets.  Personalizing insurance products and providing policies at competitive premiums are primary goals brokers have, although it is key for them to understand what factors can influence claims risk, the future continuance of policies, and the administrative overhead with managing their client policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Data Science Intensive Capstone project, my goal was to understand data wrangling and predictive modelling by machine learning so I can help my insurance broker client meet or exceed their strategic retention and growth goals.  In order to achieve this, I analyzed a life insurance data set offered by Prudential Life Insurance through a competition on Kaggle.com.  By using data analytics and machine learning techniques,  I studied a structured and fairly \"clean\" data set in order to make predictions on the ordinal categorical risk rating based on profiles of life insurance customers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The premise of this study is to show my client how insurance and customer data can be manipulated to identify important features, trends and statistics in order to make predictions and decisions in meeting their strategic goals.  "

    "\n",
    "The goal of the life insurance Kaggle competition, is to solve a multi-classification problem by assigning a categorical (ordinal) risk rating  from 1-9 for a customer profile.  The algorithm accuracy is tested by measuring the quadratic weighted kappa (QWK), the inter-rater agreement between a predicted set to the actual set of risk ratings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data set contains 127 features (minus the ID feature) consisting of categorical (ordinal), continuous (normalized), and discrete feature types. There are 48 Medical Keyword features acting as dummy variables with binary, discrete values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverables were a machine learning algorithm for predicting risk response in the Kaggle dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "An appropriate process would need to be applied to transform the data with useful features selected, a machine learning algorithm implemented and the QWK calculated to determine error in classification.  The top competitors achieved QWK scores of 0.67939."

    "The Prudential life insurance data set offered a good basis to learn and apply data analytics methodologies using Python, data analysis, visualization and predictive modelling libraries.  The goal was to determine a predictive model for risk rating prediction and classification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms and a scatter plot matrix were created to explore the relationships between risk rating and other data features.  The data set consisted of categorical, continuous and discrete datasets that were processed for NaN values and normalized.  Lasso linear regression and random forest classifiers were used. Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) was used to evaluate classifier performance as the risk ratings were categorical. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lasso linear regression offered the fastest training time and best QWK value of 0.473 with an alpha value of 0.0099.  The model is acceptable because an appropirate QWK score was determined. This model did not perform well because the low alpha value suggests overfitting and the QWK value placed 2300/2619 out of all the scores in the Kaggle competition.  The top score was 0.679.  By reducing the features used the algorithm can be improved and fine tuned to approach the top score.\n",

    "Through managerial interviews and observations of the insurance brokerage, a realistic and feasible data project was determined.  The primary goal of the project is to help form the brokers' retention strategy.  Data would be extracted from the brokers' TAMS platform (an insurance brokerage customer management program) where various managerial reports could be exported as CSV files.  The CSV files could be processed to create a similar data table to that of the Prudential Life Insurance data set.  Product lines, sales persons associated with accounts, and premium start and end dates were determined to be useful features for retention goals.  Descriptive statistics on various customer segments can be useful in determining the retenton goals for the brokerage.  The most useful intelligence would be to determine what features of the datasets contribute the most to a customer cancelling a policy after one, two and three years.  Predicting the most valuable customers prone to cancelling would form the basis of the retention strategy.\n",
