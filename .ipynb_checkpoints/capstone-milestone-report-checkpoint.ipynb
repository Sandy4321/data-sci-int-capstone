A goal for their project would be to understand how retention rates differ for different product and customer segments and how best to improve the retention rates for the upcoming months.  Determining their high value clients and the ones most likely not to renew would form a significant part of their retention focused strategy.  \n",

As a project, I wanted to analyze an insurance data set offered on Kaggle.com by Prudential Life Insurance.  The premise of the competition was to predict the risk response of a client based on a normalized dataset of current clients.  \n",
